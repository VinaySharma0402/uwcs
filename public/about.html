            <h1>About Urban Waste Control System</h1>
            <p>The <strong>Urban Waste Control System</strong> is built to revolutionize waste management by creating a bridge
                between citizens and municipal bodies. Our platform empowers communities to take control of their
                environment by streamlining the process of reporting issues and monitoring waste collection. We aim to
                enhance urban cleanliness through real-time solutions.</p>

            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>In today's rapidly growing cities, waste management is often overlooked. Our team noticed a gap between
                public reporting and municipal action, and we decided to change that. By leveraging technology, we
                envisioned a platform where citizens could raise concerns about waste collection and municipalities
                could respond more efficiently.</p>

            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>Our mission is to provide a user-friendly, effective platform that not only simplifies waste management
                but also promotes accountability. We believe that by facilitating open communication between the public
                and authorities, we can improve urban cleanliness and sustainability.</p>

            <h2>Our Vision</h2>
            <p>We envision a future where waste management becomes a seamless, collaborative effort between citizens and
                local bodies. Through our platform, we aspire to create cleaner, more sustainable cities by encouraging
                active participation in waste reporting and collection.</p>
